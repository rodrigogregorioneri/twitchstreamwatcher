# twitchstreamwatcher
so basically you run either of the start scripts and if its your first run it'll ask for your twitch username and password. After that it logs into your twitch account and watches a drops enabled valorant stream for a random amount of time with a range of about 2-36 minutes. The entire chrome instance is muted, so you won't hear the stream. Idk if that'll ruin your chances of getting a key but at least it's not using the mute button on twitch.
## Requirements
* Python. I havent tested it with any other version than [3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/)
* Google Chrome 81. `chromedriver.exe` can be replaced with a different version from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

UPDATE 4/12/2020:
Oh shit it worked
